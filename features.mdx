## Search and Navigation Functionalities

Locate content instantly with full-text search. Navigation uses breadcrumbs and a dynamic sidebar.

|---------------|-------------------------------|
| Global Search | Type keywords to find pages   |
| Filters       | Narrow by folder or tags      |
| Breadcrumbs   | Track your location in hierarchy |

<Callout kind="info">
  Pin frequently used pages to the top of the sidebar for quick access.
</Callout>

## Version Control Basics

Track changes to your docs with built-in versioning. You commit snapshots and revert if needed.

<Expandable title="Advanced Version Workflow" default-open="false">
  Integrate with Git for deeper control.
  
````bash
git add docs/
git commit -m "Update features page"
git push origin main
````
</Expandable>

<CodeGroup tabs="Commit,Revert">
```bash
# Commit changes
silly-smile commit -m "Add search improvements"
```
```bash
# Revert to previous version
silly-smile revert --version v1.2.3
```
